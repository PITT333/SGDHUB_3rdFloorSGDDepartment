[Geo_Mono9.3.3.mb]

Original .mb file for the Mono Character Model is included with this document in the Models/Mono_CharacterModel/Original folder.

The model has joints, constraints, painted skin weights, and controllers attached in Maya to be posed or animated.
Constraints and IKs are not preserved in FBX format. The model must be animated outside of Unity.
I do not recommend touching the mesh or joints (controllers only). 

If the model needs scaling in Maya, scale with the mono_world_ctrl in the hierarchy.
The model was made too small for import into this Unity project. It is still in its original scale in the Maya file.
Mono is a small character, but not that small. I recommend making him about ~45 units tall if needed. (He's maybe 2 units tall now.)

The textures are not included in the .mb, but there are placeholder materials applied that can be easily replaced from within Unity.
The correct materials for Mono are located in Mono_Materials as well as already attached on the prefab and imported FBX. (Void goes under the bag.)
